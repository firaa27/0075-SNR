Strangers From Hell

Yoon Jong-Woo (Im Si-Wan) is a man in his 20's. 
He has lived in a small town for all of his life, 
but he gets a job at a small office in Seoul. 
Yoon Jong-Woo moves out to Seoul and stays at a cheap
apartment which shares its kitchen and bathroom 
with other residents. He doesn't like staying at 
the apartment and he doesn't like the other 
residents who seem weird and suspicious.
